# Artificial Software Engieering

The principles of treating software as an artificial life specie
Motivation

Level of self organization. The software could be seen as an artificial life being that interacts with an ecosystem and shares information with other types of species (software). The idea behind this organization is to provide the software engineer with self-organization behaviour. We do not need to create more software, we need to evolve the existing one. 

Try to think of software as an entity that has initial rules and could evolve according to those rules. Like a fractal that generated complex interaction with simply local behavior. 

Challenges
Self assembly processes
Self replication processes
Self organization
Self healing

## Artificial Mind and The Consciousness of Software Engineers 

An artificial mind defined by Stan Frankley is that thing that the brains do.

In evolutionary biology we can talk about “adaptability”. For example, if we provide software systems with an artificial mind, then we can consider that software system as an intelligent system that exhibits life behavior and now we can achieve adaptability to an environment. Let's say that the software is a new component or functionality for a healthcare company, the new component will be self-adaptable in the new artificial environment. Furthermore, any artificial mind has the ability to learn from their environment. 

We should provide the software system with the following characteristics:
The ability to reproduce through mutations and transcription errors. 
Sexual reproduction by allowing the M-Soft systems to share chunks of information with other systems. 
Multicell organization to enhance productivity of division of labor
Specialized nerve cells to find food and escape predators
Intervention of central nervous system to allow rapidly adaptation to the environment

The artificial neural networks model exhibit those great leaps. 

Why explore the mechanism of mind in the context of software engineering? Understanding the coming man-machine symbiosis in this case is the way of how a software engineer exhibits intelligence to the construction of another system! Which is fascinating, a more intelligent system constructing another intelligent system. 

We must start by assuming this sentence according to Stanley: “Mind is what the brain does, or something very like it in relevant ways” So the first step to discover how a M-soft operates, we need something that approximates to a brain. 

The Natural Computation Field provides us with certain mechanisms like cellular automatas with the characteristic of modeling the brain function. Let’s consider the following model of a fully-connected neural network like a tissue. 


There are several disciplines that study mind in both ways: Top-Down (cognitive psychology or artificial intelligence) or Button-Up (Neuroscience or Robotics)

The first thing is that we have to take into account Hugo's perspective about Artificial Intelligence work. Reading about openNARS (https://github.com/opennars/opennars) and his point of view of deep learning in networking (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyovHI_WWXc), I feel that they want to build a general purpose AI system to understand how the mind operated and how that research could be useful to build thinking machines. 

From our side, I want to start working on a unified library that includes the most relevant fields from Natural Computing and Artificial Minds in order to apply both "research lines" into software engineering analysis and construction. Please bear in mind that we have to go beyond and see Software Engineering not with its conventional fields and problems (traceability, refactoring, software architecture, etc), but as an introductory field to understand and build other types of systems, in this case, intelligent systems. For instance, Can we state that a software system is a dynamic system? Can we apply dynamic and complexity theory to analyze software systems? How can we prove that a software system is alive and can create autonomous behavior? How can we create a software system that thinks? Hugo is interested in causality theory as a mechanism that supports the decision process from a machine. 

Natural Computing is the field of research that investigates human-designed computing inspired by nature (e.g., neural networks) as well as computing taking place in nature (e.g. the computational nature of bacterial communication). Here are the most important subfields:
Cellular Automata
Neural computation ( SEMERU has some experience in this field with deep learning! )
Evolutionary computation (SEMERU has used some optimization strategies in software engineering, but never use evolutionary computation to really evolve a system)
Molecular computation (e.g DNA computing, bacterial computing, membrane computing)
Quantum computation (e.g quantum cryptography, quantum information system, but never heard something about quantum requirements for sw engineering)
Nature Inspired Algorithms (e.g. simulated annealing, swarm intelligence, artificial immune systems)
Alternative models of Computation (artificial life, algorithmic system biology, nonclassical computation- dynamical systems)
Artificial Minds study how the mind arises from brains or from machines. This area is based on cognitive sciences. Here are the most important subfields:
The nature of mind


Animal Minds
Brain and consciousness
Communication among Animals
Self-Awareness
Symbolic AI
Connectionism 
Evolution of mind
Artificial Life
Patterns Behaviour 
My final thought is that we should stop looking for how to use a specific machine learning/data mining/information retrieval/evolutionary computation technique and fit it to solve a specific software engineering automatization problem. Instead, I propose to go beyond and start looking at both areas, Natural Computing and Software Engineering, as a cross-disciplinary field. Could we propose a software system with an artificial mind that takes decisions based on its context? Could we extract the mind of a developer into an in-Silico system? Is there any way to evolve a software system like any other biological system? How can we transmit consciousness to a software system?

We have a tremendous opportunity here, Software Engineering is providing us with all empirical experience and real applications, and Natural Computation with all the novelty and knowledge of cognitive science and intelligent systems. We have to guarantee that both areas are communicating and merging to deal with new challenges, definitely not try to work with conventional software engineer problems. I think we should propose Hugo to start working on a library of Artificial Mind Techniques (which includes causality theory) and, then, build that general purpose system, which exhibits complex relations to be extended into real Software Engineering practices. 
 

A developer agent

The idea of creating a development agent has emerged from the recent empirical studies where the behavior of the developer is exposed. Let's consider the following summary of behaviours:

Let’s consider here all the activities that a developer can do for a software system.

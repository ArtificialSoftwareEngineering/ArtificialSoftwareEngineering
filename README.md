Software Evolution studied under the framework of Natural Computation
How can we describe software evolution from natural computation?

Software Evolution and Biology?

Evolutionary Computation (optimization) and Software Evolution (software construction in an automated fashion). The scope must be how is the software evolution and interactions (that’s why traceability is important?). 

Understanding bioinformation for software engineering advancements,. 

“Thus the chapter surveys discussions and viewpoints about the very nature of the differences between living and nonliving systems, and goes on to consider issues such as hierarchical design, self-construction, and self-maintenance, and the emergence of complexity”

Can we enable self-organization in software systems? What would be self-organization in a software? Modularity? Source code well distributed in packages?

Software evolution ---> changes in the environment ---> self-organization ---> self-adaptability?
Can the adaptability in a software system emerge? Bugs--->Natural Evolution
Issues ---> Signals from the environment.

What would be a hierarchy in software systems? How do we construct software systems right now?

2.3 Constructive and Autopoietic Systems
A problem closely associated with emergence and hierarchy, yet somewhat distinct, is that of ‘‘self-constructing’’ systems. Natural
Are software systems Autopoietic Systems?

**I want to enable all those toy examples of ALife in Real Software Engineering environments 

“The latter may well have complex hierarchical organization, but this organization is typically static: The system is assembled once, and then retains its fixed compositional structure for its functional lifetime” → can we enable dynamic organization of the software while the software is still in production?

Towards an autopoietic software systems

Testing this document for Interpreatable Representation Learning for Software Engineering



## Interpretable Deep Code Generators
### Conditioned Interpratability
### Unconditioned Interpretability

## Deep Learning Representation of Software Artifiacts
### Disentangling Code by Using AutoEncoders
This project looks for finding and understanding features of software artifacts (source code, requirements, etc)

## Feature Engineering Software Artifacts
### Information Science Traceability
### Decomposing Software Features via Self-Organization
The purpose of this study is to implement a mechanism of self-organization that assembles Java Classes from deep code generated methods. The self-organization approach relies on Genetic Algorithms, Information Science, and Software Metrics.

# Artificial Software Engieering

The principles of treating software as an artificial life specie
Motivation

Level of self organization. The software could be seen as an artificial life being that interacts with an ecosystem and shares information with other types of species (software). The idea behind this organization is to provide the software engineer with self-organization behaviour. We do not need to create more software, we need to evolve the existing one. 

Try to think of software as an entity that has initial rules and could evolve according to those rules. Like a fractal that generated complex interaction with simply local behavior.
